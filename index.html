        <p>Genetic engineering (also called genetic modification) is a process that uses laboratory-based technologies to alter the DNA makeup of an 
            organism. This may involve changing a single base pair (A-T or C-G), deleting a region of DNA or adding a new segment of DNA. For example,
            genetic engineering may involve adding a gene from one species to an organism from a different species to produce a desired trait.</p>
