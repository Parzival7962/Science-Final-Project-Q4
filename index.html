        <h1> Science Final Project Q4: All About GMOs!</h1
        
        <h2> What is Genetic Engineering?:<h2>
            
        <p> Genetic engineering (also called genetic modification) is a process that uses laboratory-based technologies to alter the DNA makeup of an organism. 
            This may involve changing a single base pair (A-T or C-G), deleting a region of DNA or adding a new segment of DNA. For example, genetic engineering 
            may involve adding a gene from one species to an organism from a different species to produce a desired trait.</p>
            
        <h2> What is a GMO?: </h2>

        <img src="https://ag.purdue.edu/gmos/_media/what-are-gmos.png">
            
        <p> GMOs are organisms whose genome has been engineered in the laboratory in order to favor the expression of desired physiological traits or the generation of 
            desired biological products. In conventional livestock production, crop farming, and even pet breeding, In genetic modification, recombinant genetic technologies 
            are employed to produce organisms whose genomes have been precisely altered at the molecular level, usually by the inclusion of genes from unrelated species of 
            organisms that code for traits that would not be obtained easily through conventional selective breeding. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are produced using 
            scientific methods that include recombinant DNA technology and reproductive cloning.</p>

        <h2> What Role Does Genetic Engineering Play in Agriculture and the Production of Genetically Modified (GM) Crops?:</h2>
            
        <p> Most of the GMO crops grown today were developed to help farmers prevent crop loss. The three most common traits found in GMO crops are, Resistance to insect damage, 
            Tolerance to herbicides, Resistance to plant viruses.</p>

        <h2>What are the Economic Impacts of Genetic Engineering on Biotech Startups and Established Companies?:<h2>
            
        <p> Over the period 1996 to 2020, the economic benefits have been significant with farm incomes for those using the technology having increased by $261.3 billion US dollars. 
            This equates to an average farm income gain across all GM crops grown in this period of about $112/hectare. In 2020, the farm income gains were $18.8 billion (average of $103/ha). 
            The cumulative farm income gains have been divided 52% to farmers in developing countries and 48% to farmers in developed countries. Seventy-two percent of the gains have derived 
            from yield and production gains with the remaining 28% coming from cost savings.</p>
