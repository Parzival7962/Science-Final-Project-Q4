        <h2>What is Genetic Engineering?:</h2>

        <p>Genetic engineering (also called genetic modification) is a process that uses laboratory-based technologies to alter the DNA makeup of an 
            organism. This may involve changing a single base pair (A-T or C-G), deleting a region of DNA or adding a new segment of DNA. For example,
            genetic engineering may involve adding a gene from one species to an organism from a different species to produce a desired trait.</p>
        
        <h2>What are GMOs?:</h2>
        
        <p>GMOs are organisms whose genome has been engineered in the laboratory in order to favor the expression of desired physiological traits 
            or the generation of desired biological products. In conventional livestock production, crop farming, and even pet breeding, 
            In genetic modification, recombinant genetic technologies are employed to produce organisms whose genomes have been precisely altered at 
            the molecular level, usually by the inclusion of genes from unrelated species of organisms that code for traits that would not be obtained 
            easily through conventional selective breeding. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are produced using scientific methods that include 
            recombinant DNA technology and reproductive cloning.</p>
